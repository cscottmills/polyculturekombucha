<h2 class="post--title">About us</h2>

Polyculture is a small kombucha brewery in Maple City, Michigan, started by Kelly Kieft and Scott Mills. We bring years of experience observing nature, growing food, foraging, and cooking to our fermentation practice, and Polyculture is a culmination of it all. Behind each of our [brews](/flavors) is a deep reverence for the ingredients, their functions, their origins, and their flavors.

We began brewing kombucha for ourselves in 2011 while living in Portland, Oregon, where we were owner-members of a small cooperative called [Four Door Farm][1]{:target="\_blank"}. During that time we began to learn about [permaculture][2]{:target="_blank"}, explore functional foods, and discover the magic of fermentation. When we moved back to Northern Michigan in the spring of 2014, a single batch of kombucha with our beloved SCOBYs rode with us eastward, safe in the back seat. Today, we brew every batch with the descendants of that well-traveled mother culture.

We have long felt the benefits of kombucha in our own lives --- in the form of delight, reciprocity, digestive health, vitality --- and we are so excited to share it with you!

<h2 class="post--title">Polyculture?</h2>

In permaculture, the word *polyculture* is used to describe a diverse assemblage of plants emulating a larger ecosystem. Polycultures are dynamic, resilient, self-regulating systems that get stronger with time. We love the complexity and reverence that the word suggests, and are delighted by the parallels to fermentation, the kombucha SCOBY being a kind of polyculture itself; a dynamic community of many species of bacteria and yeast. Besides, the word can double as a lovely aspiration for our human communities as well.

<h2 class="post--title">Small is beautiful</h2>

At Polyculture, we think small is beautiful: small farms, small businesses, small batches. Small is not the same as miniature --- small is *concentrated*, and it plays the biggest role in strengthening our community. Drink to that!
