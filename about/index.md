<h2 class="post--title">About us</h2>

Polyculture is a small, [something] kombucha brewery in Maple City, Michigan run by Kelly Kieft and Scott Mills. [Something else]

[...]

We began brewing kombucha for ourselves in 2011 while living in Portland, Oregon. When we moved back to Michigan in 2014, a single batch of kombucha with our beloved SCOBYs rode with us eastward, safe in the back seat. The idea for Polyculture began to take shape soon thereafter. Today, we brew every batch with the descendants of that [pioneering] culture.

<h2 class="post--title">Small is beautiful</h2>

At Polyculture, we think small is beautiful: small farms, small businesses, small batches. Small is not the same as miniature --- small is *concentrated*, and it plays the biggest role in strengthening our community. Drink to that!
