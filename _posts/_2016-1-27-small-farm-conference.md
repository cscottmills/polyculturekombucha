We'll be at the [Small Farm Conference][1]{:target="_blank"} out at the Grand Traverse Resort all day Saturday. We won't be selling kombucha there this year (maybe next?), but if you see us wandering around between sessions, come say hello. We're so excited to hear all the [amazing people][2] speak!

On a related note, this week's deliveries will happen on Sunday.
