title: Deliveries!

We're excited to announce that from here on, we'll be [delivering](/buy#deliveries) kombucha directly to all our subscribers and order-ers! After hearing that central pick-ups weren't ideal for most of you, we realized that not only are deliveries perfectly feasible, but a really nice way to get to know the people who enjoy Polyculture. We've been delivering subscriptions to a few of you all along, and now it's our pleasure to offer this to everyone.

We'll continue to do things on the same every-other-Saturday schedule, with the next delivery scheduled for **Saturday, November 21**. If you do want to meet us somewhere in Traverse City for an impromptu pick-up, just [drop us a line](/contact) and we'll find a time and place.

We feel continually humbled and grateful to be able to share the best kombucha we can make with such an inspiring community of people. Thank you all!
