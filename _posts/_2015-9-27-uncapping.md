We are so excited to share Polyculture with all of you! Join us on Saturday, October 10 at our friends' beautiful farm for the uncapping party! There will be tons of free kombucha to go around, live music, new friends, old friends, and good vibes to spare.

This will be your first opportunity to get in on our kombucha subscription, or to place an order for a six-pack or two --- so come prepared if that sounds like something you're interested in.

**Saturday, October 10**  
**3 &ndash; 7pm**  
**Maple City**

Drop by anytime and stay for as long as you like. Kids are more than welcome. Bring a picnic! We can't wait to see you there!

&mdash; Kelly & Scott
