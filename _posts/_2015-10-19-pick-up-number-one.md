We'll be holding the first pick-up at our house in Maple City, since that's convenient for most of our subscribers. Here are the details:

**Saturday, October 24**  
**12 &ndash; 2pm**  
[**8510 S Maple St, Maple City**](https://goo.gl/maps/o33DRAZ63nP2){:target="_blank"}

But don't worry, we're still working out a good spot in Traverse City to hold them regularly. We'll have that sorted out before the next pick-up at the beginning of November. In the meantime, we are happy to arrange a special delivery to you in or around Traverse City. [Let us know](/contact) how we can make it work for you. If it's local kombucha you want, we'll make sure you get it!
