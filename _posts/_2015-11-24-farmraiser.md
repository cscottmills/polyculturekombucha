The good folks at Leelanau Montessori up in Suttons Bay have launched a FarmRaiser campaign to raise money for their students to visit Leelanau Outdoor Center this year, and we're delighted to offer three-packs of our kombucha alongside a bunch of other awesome local goods. Go take a look at the [fundraiser page][1]{:target="_blank"} and support the wonderful work the montessori is doing. Besides, it's a perfect way to try all three of our [flavors](/flavors) for the first time!
