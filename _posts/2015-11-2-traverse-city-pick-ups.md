Starting this Saturday we'll be holding tastings/pick-ups every other Saturday from **10am &ndash; 2pm** at the [Human Nature School](http://humannatureschool.org/){:target="_blank"} headquarters in the Grand Traverse Commons. Everyone is invited! We'll have a bunch of kombucha available for sale and to sample, so come thirsty and bring friends:

**Saturday, November 7**  
**10am &ndash; 2pm**  
[**1200 West 11th St, Traverse City**](https://goo.gl/maps/6ydC7ef6PMr){:target="_blank"}  
**Suite 112**

You can park in the cul-de-sac at the end of 11th, and you'll find us on the right just as you enter the building. The farmers market will be happening down the hall in the Mercado that morning as well!

We're so grateful to our friends at the Human Nature School for allowing us to use their space as our permanent every-other-Saturday pick-up location. If you haven't heard about the wonderful work they're doing, check them out.

Between now and then, feel free to [place an order](/buy) to put your name on some kombucha. See you there!
