There's no sense in playing favorites with the months, but my goodness is May lovely. The days are getting warmer and longer here in Leelanau County, and new buds and blooms and sprouts appear every time we walk through the garden. The honeybees we tend are in full form, bringing in lots of bright pollen and beginning store up nectar. They arrived as a swarm last June, so this summer will be their first full one here in our yard. From what we can tell, we'll be able to harvest some honey over the course of the season. One day we hope to harvest enough ourselves to use it in our [Wildflower Honey](/flavors) kombucha, but in the meantime, there's no beating Champion Hill Farm.

In other news, we've moved our brewery to a brand new incubator space in Traverse City called Center City Kitchen. It's a great space, and the owner Ryan is doing a fantastic job. Moving into that space has been a huge step toward bringing Polyculture to all of you. We're on schedule to offer kombucha for sale early this summer.

Now, if you'll excuse me, the robins singing in the maple tree are calling me back outside. Happy May to you all!
