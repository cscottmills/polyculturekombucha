One of the great perks of being a small brewery is that we're able to embed intention in every detail of our kombucha. A bottle of Polyculture --- with the conspicuous exception of the *bottle* itself --- is made entirely by our hands. As operations like ours grow, it seems that the point where intention is embedded migrates away from the act of making one batch, toward the management of a process that yields many similar batches over and over. Small feels great right now, and we're savoring the perks.
