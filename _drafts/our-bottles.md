We bottle our kombucha in standard 12oz amber glass bottles. Not only do these vessels protect the probiotics from UV light and do a great job at containing the natural carbonation we work so hard for, but they are strong, ubiquitous, and indefinitely reusable to boot. We sanitize bottles that spent their first lives holding beer, and give them a shot at immortality holding delicious kombucha over and over again. You can help by returning your empty bottles!
