<h2 class="post--title" id="deliveries">Deliveries</h2>

Deliveries happen every other Saturday. When you begin a subscription or place an order, we'll agree to deliver your kombucha to your home, place of business, or a convenient meeting place. We love getting to know the people who enjoy Polyculture, so delivering it to you is a privilege!

The next delivery will take place on **Saturday, February 13**.

If Saturdays aren't good for you, we're happy to work with your schedule. And as always, you can [arrange](/contact) to pick up your bottles directly from us anytime in Maple City. Let us know how we can get you some kombucha!
