The first pick-up will be from **12 &ndash; 2pm** on **Saturday, October 24** at [our house][1]{:target="_blank"} in Maple City. We're still in the process of finding a good location in Traverse City, but we'll have that sorted out by the next pick-up. In the meantime, we're happy to arrange special deliveries in or around Traverse City. Just [drop us a line](/contact).

As always, you can [arrange](/contact) to pick up your kombucha directly from us anytime in Maple City. Let us know how we can make pick-ups work best for you.
