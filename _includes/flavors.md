<h2 class="post--title">How we brew</h2>

We start each batch with four solid ingredients: Maple City well water, a blend of organic green tea leaves from Arbor Teas, organic cane sugar from Florida, and one of our cherished SCOBYs. After a full fourteen days of fermentation in a glass vessel, we infuse each batch with organic herbs, fruits, and such. Fourteen more days fermenting in the bottle, and we have a crisp, delightfully fizzy kombucha, alive and ready to share!
