<h2 class="post--title">How we brew</h2>

We start each batch with four solid ingredients: Maple City well water, a blend of organic green tea leaves from [Arbor Teas][1]{:target="_blank"}, organic cane sugar from Florida, and one of our cherished SCOBYs. After a full fourteen days of fermentation in a glass vessel, we infuse each batch with organic herbs, fruits, and such. Fourteen more days fermenting in the bottle, and we have a crisp, delightfully fizzy kombucha, alive and ready to share!

<h2 class="post--title">About our tea</h2>

We use our own blend of three lovely green teas from the Eastern Hemisphere:

**Makaibari Estate**  
[Darjeeling][2]{:target="_blank"}, India  
Organic, fair trade, biodynamically farmed

**Ceylon Idulgashinna Estate**  
[Uva Province][3]{:target="_blank"}, Sri Lanka  
Organic, fair trade, biodynamically farmed

**Sencha**  
[Kagoshima Prefecture][4]{:target="_blank"}, Japan  
Organic

<h2 class="post--title">Our bottles</h2>

We bottle our kombucha in standard 12oz amber glass bottles. Not only do these vessels protect the probiotics from UV light and contain the natural carbonation we work so hard to foster, but they are strong, ubiquitous, and indefinitely reusable to boot. We sanitize bottles that spent their first lives holding beer, and give them a shot at immortality holding delicious kombucha over and over again. You can help by returning your empty bottles to us!
