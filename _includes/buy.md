You can also buy kombucha directly from our brewery in Traverse City. [Send Kelly a message](mailto:kelly@polyculturekombucha.com), and she will fix you up with however many bottles you'd like.

<h2 class="post--title">Why the beer department?</h2>

The federal government has chosen to define certain foods containing more than 0.5% alcohol by volume as 'alcoholic beverages', and ever since kombucha has become popular, it's been lumped under that definition. Kombucha naturally exceeds that arbitrary level by a small amount, but common sense tells us that it's not *really* an alcoholic beverage (in human rather than bureaucratic terms). We choose to brew Polyculture to taste, rather than to an arbitrary prescription -- and so you'll find it in the beer department. Here's to real kombucha!
