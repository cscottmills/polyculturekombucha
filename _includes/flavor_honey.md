<h2 class="title orange"><b>Honey</b></h2>

Honey is the summer sun captured, the land distilled &mdash; a sacred substance. In this brew, we use raw wildflower honey from [Champion Hill Farm][1]{:target="_blank"}, who keeps hives year-round in fields and meadows all over Leelanau and Benzie Counties. The result is tart, effervescent, and floral.
