From the forests and fields of lovely Maple City comes Polyculture, Leelanau's very own brew!

Currently, we're hard at work laying the foundation so we can offer the best kombucha to our community. Polyculture will be available for sale starting this spring!

If you have any questions, or just want to say hello, [get in touch](/contact)!
