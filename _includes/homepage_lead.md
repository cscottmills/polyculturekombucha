From the forests and fields of lovely Maple City comes Polyculture, Leelanau's very own brew!

Currently, we're hard at work laying the foundation to share the best kombucha with our community. Polyculture will be available for sale starting this summer!

If you have any questions, or just want to say hello, [get in touch](/contact)!
